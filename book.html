        <ol>
            <li><h3>Introduction</h3>In this chapter, we delve into the utilization of Java, a robust and versatile general-purpose programming language, to bring to fruition the meticulously analyzed system outlined in the preceding chapters. Here, we explore the seamless integration of Java with the database system discussed earlier and elucidate how this synergy forms the backbone of our comprehensive solution. 
            </li>
                <li><h3>Tools used to develop this system in java programming:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eclipse IDE: an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. It is the second-most-popular IDE for Java development, and, until 2016, was the most popular.</li>
                    <li>JAR stands for Java Archive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and
                        is used for aggregating many files into one. Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool, the primary motivation for its development was so that Java applets and their requisite components.
